### This Streamlit app is an assignment from my course where I created an application for exploratory data analysis of the 'Tips' dataset. I demonstrated the difference before and after data wrangling. Finally, I used machine learning algorithms to predict the 'tip' amount based on the 'total bill' amount. The user has the ability to change the parameters of the training data and select from different machine learning algorithms.
